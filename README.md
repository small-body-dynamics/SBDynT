# SBDynT
We are developing a well-documented, open-source Python package, the Small Body Dynamics Tool (SBDynT), that can be used to calculate a variety of dynamical parameters and determine dynamical characterizations and classifications from integrations of a solar system small bodyâ€™s orbital evolution.

### Current state of development
We are in the very early stages of development, primarily focusing on adding individual functions that will later be incoporated into a larger work-flow. Functions currently available are shown in the demonstration notebook in the example-notebooks directory. These include already useful tools to generate clones of an observed small body's orbit over its orbit uncertainties using JPL's orbit fit and associated covariance matrix and to initialize and run rebound simulations for those clones.

### Requirements and installation
Currently, to use SBDynT, download the repository and add the following to your python code:<br>
import sys<br>
sys.path.insert(0,'path-to-where-you-downloaded-the-repository/SBDynT-main/src')<br>

The following packages must be installed:<br>
rebound -- Version 4+<br>
numpy<br>
astroquery
